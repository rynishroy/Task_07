Alex: Coach Autry! Glad we caught you — thanks for taking the time. Let’s talk Syracuse basketball. How would you sum up the 2024–25 season?

Adrian Autry: Great to see you too, Alex. You know, this season was a mix of progress and growing pains. We had some really promising moments — especially on the offensive end. Our guards showed confidence, we shot well from beyond the arc, and our younger players matured quickly. But at the same time, we had trouble maintaining that momentum through four full quarters. A lot of close games just slipped away in the final minutes.

Alex: Right, I remember watching a few of those where it felt like Syracuse had it — and then it unraveled late. What do you think was behind that?

Adrian Autry: Fatigue played a huge role. We saw it in the stats and on the court. Our plus-minus took a serious dip in the last five minutes of games. Players were just gassed — we weren’t rotating quickly enough, and the legs weren’t there defensively. Add to that some breakdowns in communication, and suddenly you’ve got turnovers, missed assignments, and open shots for the other team. We lost more than a few games by a possession or two.

Alex: That’s tough. What would you say was the most frustrating part from a coaching perspective?

Adrian Autry: Defensive rebounding, without a doubt. We gave up far too many second-chance opportunities. You can’t afford to defend for 20 seconds, force a miss, and then give it right back. That wears on a team mentally. We were undersized at times, sure, but rebounding is also about hustle and positioning. We’re working on both.

Alex: Let’s flip the script. What went right this season? Any players who stood out?

Adrian Autry: Oh, definitely. Our sophomore shooting guard was a real bright spot. His shooting efficiency jumped, he made smarter decisions, and he really grew into a leadership role. Also, our point guard — while still learning — showed great composure and led the team in assists. They’ve both got a lot more to give, and we’re just scratching the surface with them.

Alex: That’s exciting to hear. So what does the offseason look like? What are you and the staff focusing on?

Adrian Autry: The theme this offseason is conditioning and control. We’re putting in work to build stamina so our players can perform at a high level through all four quarters. Strength training, nutrition — we’re attacking it from every angle. On the floor, we’re focusing on decision-making and team ball movement. We had too many possessions where the ball stuck. That slows everything down and makes us predictable. We want more assists, more drive-and-kick, more motion.

Alex: And defensively?

Adrian Autry: That’s another big one. We’re evaluating whether to move away from our traditional zone. It’s been a hallmark of Syracuse basketball, no doubt, but teams have started to figure it out. We need to keep them guessing. We’re experimenting with some hybrid sets — switching between zone and man — to keep opponents off balance. Flexibility is going to be key.

Alex: Sounds like you’re approaching this offseason with intent. What’s your outlook for next season?

Adrian Autry: I’m feeling really optimistic. We’ve got some experienced players returning, and we’ve added a few high-motor recruits who bring energy and toughness. If we stay healthy, stay focused, and execute in the fourth quarter — I really believe we’ll be in the mix for a tournament run. But it’s about more than just making the tournament. We want to be dangerous when we get there.

Alex: Love that mindset. Before I let you go — what’s your message to Syracuse fans?

Adrian Autry: Keep believing in this team. These players care. They’re putting in the work this offseason, and we’re committed to giving them every chance to succeed. We felt the crowd’s energy all year — even during the tough losses — and we want to make you proud next season. The foundation’s there. Now we’re building the finish.

Alex: That’s what we love to hear. Thanks for the time, Coach. Looking forward to what’s ahead.

Adrian Autry: Appreciate it, Alex. Go Orange!
