##  Project Title
**Syracuse Men’s Basketball 2024–25: Stakeholder Decision Report with Ethical Review**

---

##  Purpose
This project turns an LLM-generated narrative based on Syracuse basketball statistics into a stakeholder-facing decision report. It includes actionable recommendations for coaching staff and administration, with a focus on transparency, ethics, data integrity, and reproducibility.

---

##  Tools Used

- **CloudTTS** – For realistic voice synthesis of the interview audio
- **ChatGPT / GPT-4o** – For generating and refining narrative, recommendations, and stakeholder framing
- **Excel** – For original statistical summaries and exploratory data validation
- **Markdown & GitHub** – For documentation and public archiving

##  Workflow / Process

1. **LLM Narrative Creation**: Built an interview-based narrative using LLM prompting around Syracuse Men’s Basketball performance.
2. **Voice Synthesis**: Generated a realistic interview audio using CloudTTS with separate voices for Alex and Coach Autry.
3. **Video Tool Exploration**: Attempted multiple free video platforms (D-ID, HeyGen, Pictory) but could not generate a full video due to paywalls.
4. **Script Finalization**: Structured the conversation as a street-style interview with clear transitions and action-focused coaching insights.
5. **Stakeholder Report Prep**: Created a decision-making document containing findings, tiered recommendations, and ethical analysis.
6. **Documentation**: Archived scripts, prompts, outputs, and rationale for reproducibility and audit.

## Challenges Faced

- **Video Generation Limitations**: Most AI video tools either watermarked output or limited video length without a subscription.
- **Multispeaker Alignment**: TTS generation for both voices required careful timing and clip sequencing.
- **Data Scope**: Publicly available Syracuse stats limited the ability to validate deeper inferences (e.g., player-level fatigue rates).
- **LLM Hallucination Risk**: Prompt output required close review for speculative or overly confident language.

---

##  What Worked

- **CloudTTS** produced high-quality, distinct voices for both interview characters.
- **Script format** enabled natural delivery, making the audio more engaging than a static report.
- **Reproducibility focus** kept every output (script, audio, analysis) trackable and auditable.
